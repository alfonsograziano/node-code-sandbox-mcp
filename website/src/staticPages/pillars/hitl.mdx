          A2HA opens the door to something powerful: AI agents that can route their questions to the <strong className="text-green-400">right</strong> human, not just any human. Just like a software engineer knows who to ask for a security review, who to involve for architectural decisions and who owns a specific part of the product, an AI agent using A2HA can leverage metadata like skills, ownership, responsibility, availability and other factors to decide which human should receive its request.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          This prevents irrelevant pings to the wrong people and ensures that key decisions are reviewed by the appropriate experts. In practice, A2HA enables a form of intelligent "review routing" that boosts both team efficiency and trust: the agent becomes a respectful collaborator who asks the right person at the right time.
